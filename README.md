# Lab 1
## Getting Started
If you have not previously used IntelliJ to clone code from Github, please follow these steps first:
- Install Java 17 (you need JDK) and IntelliJ IDE (Community edition), and create an account on Github if you don't have one. Please use your USF email for the Github account.
- Go to your github repository with the starter code for the lab using the browser and click on the green button that says "Code"; you will see the URL of the repository - copy it, since you will need it for the next step.
- Clone a copy of the repository to your local machine. You can do it from IntelliJ by selecting New->Project from Version Control, and following the instructions. Once IntelliJ successfully clones the repository to your local machine and opens the project, click on `Project` in the vertical bar on the left hand side, and then on the arrow next to the name of the project to see the starter code for the practice exercise. 
- Work on the problems by adding/editing code in IntelliJ. The description of each exercise is in the comments.
- Commit and Push your code frequently as you work on the problems, and verify that your final solution is what you see on Github.  To commit and push your code, right click on the name of the project and select Git -> Commit Directory, select the files, add a comment, and finally, in the bottom right corner select Commit and Push.
